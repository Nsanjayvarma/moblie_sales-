Power BI Sales Dashboard Project
Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze mobile and laptop sales data. Key features include dynamic KPIs (total sales, units sold, average price), visualizations for sales trends, brand performance, regional distribution, and customer insights. Implemented slicers for region, product type, and date to enable real-time filtering and data exploration.

# questions
What is the total sales revenue and how does it compare to the average price?

Which brand generated the highest sales revenue?

Which region has the highest quantity sold and what might be driving it?

What trends can be observed in sales over time? Are there any seasonal spikes or drops?

How are laptops and mobile phones distributed across brands in terms of sales?

Which region has the highest concentration of customers?

How many unique products were sold, and what does that imply about inventory or product variety?

 Filter-Based Scenario Questions
If we filter for 'Mobile Phones' only, how does the brand performance shift?

What changes in insights occur when analyzing only the 'South' region?

How would you identify underperforming brands using this dashboard?

 Technical/Design Thinking Questions
What measures and calculated columns might have been created in Power BI for this dashboard?

Which visualizations are best suited for showing product performance over time and why?

How could you enhance this dashboard with drill-through or tooltips?

What additional data fields would improve the insights from this report (e.g., profit margin, customer feedback)?
